The collaboration of a college professor and a secondary school
principal has produced an edition which is at once scholarly and
practical. While providing the pupil with plenty of help in coping
with lingulatic difficulties, it lays special stress on the aesthetic and
artistic side. Thus the ordinary notes are supplemented by others,
which deal with the whole paragraph or section‚ and call attention
to important stylistic features, the careful structure of the narrative,
the harmonies of sound aud sense, and the artistic variations of the
hexameter. The student using this edition will never be allowed
to forget that he is studying a poet. Attention is also called to the
following
