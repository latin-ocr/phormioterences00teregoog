INTRODUOTION

ΙΝ the prosperous years that followed the Second Punic .

War there lived at Rome a celebrated group of literary
men, known in history as the Scipionio circle. Here
were the younger Scipio Africanus, the most distinguished
citizen of his generation, Laelius who, along with Scipio,
figures in Cicero's dialogue On Friendship, Polybius the
historian, Panaetius the philosopher, and other rnen de
voted to letters and Greek culture. It was under their
encouragement and guidance that Terence wrote. The
story of his life, as it has come down to us, is quickly
told. Born at Carthago about 190 rac, he was brought
to Rome as a slave boy and lived in the household of a
senator, Terentius Lucanus, who gave him e careful edu·

the name Publius Terentius, the African. He soon won
distinction cs a poet by writing six plays oi the type
called fabulae pollictor, which are close imitatione in
Latinos certain Greek comedies The titles of his plays
are The Mcid of Andros, The Mother-irchro, Tic Self-
Tormertlor, lee Eunuch, The PlrorraiO, and The Brothcrs.

They were produced on the stage at Rome in this order j

between 166 and 160 no. Terence then went to Greece

to continue his literary work, but died the next year. ,

diction, the exquisite purity of languagc, are qualities
