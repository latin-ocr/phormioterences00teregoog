plan of theold men to have Antipho and Phanium marry,
and here it had eome about unsuggestffl and unaided.
Chremes acquaints Demipho with the wonderful news.
Itis evident that the arrangement with Phormio must be
annulledâ€š and so they hastily seek him out, Demipho
demanding his money back. But the parasite, knowing
well enough that Antipho will not be torn from his bride,
puts on the bold frorit of an injured party. The old men
threaten to forne the money from him by law, but Phor-
mio retorts by exposing in loud tonos Chremes' double
life. The guilty old man is thunderstruok. He tries to
stop the gossip's mouth, but it is too late3 for Nausis-
trata, hearing the hubbub, eomes forth and soon gethers
new light on her husband's frequent visits to Lemnos.
Having now the whip hand over Chremes and being her-
self not opposed to Phaedria's match, she makes it elear
that the lovers are to be made happy.
