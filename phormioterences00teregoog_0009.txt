PREFAOE , ’ν

not found in Lodge's Vocabulory of Hiplr School Latia¹
ere marked with a degger (t), but as many of these are
nevertheless Ciceronian or Caesarian, the fact is indicated
by ‘ Cic! or ‘Caes' iu brackets. A study of these words
will reveal the fact thet the present limits of our High
School Latin vocabulary fail to embrace a large number oi
· everyday ideas.

As to syntax, great cere has been taken tc mehe the
text conform to Ciceronian usage, and no construction is
employed, which is not generally recognized as classical.

The following is α list of the principel changes made
in diction and syntex. The original text is given in the
first column, the adopted text in the second. The nu-
merals refer to the lines in the standard editions of
Terence, cy. Dziatzko's.

54. neclexisse quod neglexisti ,
55. adeo eo

59. modo ut modo

62. ausculta (ci. 996) audi

64. gnatus (ci. 422 end often) filius

69. desinas desine

73. mi usus venit mihi usuvenit

79. obsequi quae vellent voluntati eorum obsequi ⁴
91. illi ibi

95. hicviciniae in hac vicinitate
97. exadvorsum ex adverso

ing equivalent, and even Horace employs it. Occasionally words arc .
retained which, though used by Cicero, are not found in precisely the
¹same sense. But ii ratic means both account and reason, we are justi·
fied in using ratiuncula oi a ¹ slight account' as well aa a ‘slight rea·
son,' as Cicero has it. On the other hand, ilico (195) is retained, because
though the local sense is the Terentian one here, the temporal (Ciceron-
ian) meaning is well suited to the context.

² They number 195, and ot those only 96 are used by neither Caesar
norClcero.
